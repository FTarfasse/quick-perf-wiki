Sometimes, QuickPerf can display a web url in the console. It is useful to have a clickable web url in your IDE, to be able to open it by a simple click.

### IntelliJ
Web URL are clickable since IntelliJ 2019.

For oldest versions, you can use [Awesome console](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7677-awesome-console) plugin.

ðŸ’¡ If links are displayed on more one line, uncheck _Use soft wraps in console_ (Editor -> General -> Console).
