N+1 select antipattern can lead to many JDBC roundtrips in production.

With QuickPerf you can easily detect and fix this antipattern from your tests.

QuickPerf automatically detects that the tested code uses _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_. When a test is failing possibly due to an N+1 select, QuickPerf proposes ways to fix an N+1 select with _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_:

```
Perhaps you are facing a N+1 select issue
	* With Hibernate, you may fix it by using JOIN FETCH
	                                       or LEFT JOIN FETCH
	                                       or FetchType.LAZY
	                                       or ...
```
```
	* With Spring Data JPA, you may fix it by adding
		@EntityGraph(attributePaths = { "..." }) on repository method.
