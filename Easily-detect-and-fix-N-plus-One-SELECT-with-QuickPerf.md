*N+1* select antipattern can lead to many JDBC roundtrips in production.

With QuickPerf you can easily detect and fix this antipattern from your tests.

# What is an N+1 select?

## N+1 select coming from an eager fetch type

Let's suppose that your project contains a Player JPA entity having a many to one association with a Team entity:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```
The fetch type is not specified. In JPA, the default fetching policy of @ManyToOne is EAGER.

The following SQL script was executed: 
```sql
    INSERT INTO TEAM VALUES (1, 'Manchester United');
    INSERT INTO TEAM VALUES (2, 'Atl√©tico de Madrid');

    INSERT INTO PLAYER VALUES (1, 'Paul', 'Pogba', 1);
    INSERT INTO PLAYER VALUES (2, 'Antoine', 'Griezmann', 2);
```

And let's suppose that your application is executing the following "FROM Player" Java Persistence query:
```java
     TypedQuery<Player> fromPlayer = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player", Player.class);
     List<Player> players = fromPlayer.getResultList();
```


The following SQL statements are then sent to the database:
```
    select
        player0_.id as id1_0_,
        player0_.firstName as firstNam2_0_,
        player0_.lastName as lastName3_0_,
        player0_.team_id as team_id4_0_ 
    from
        Player player0_"], Params:[()]
```

```
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?"], Params:[(1)]
```

```
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?"], Params:[(2)]
```

Because of the default EAGER fetch type, for each player a SELECT statement is executed to retrieve his team.

This N+1 select can be fixed by specifying a LAZY fetch type:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```


## N+1 select with a lazy fetch type...

Now, let's suppose that your project contains a Player JPA entity having a many to one association with a Team entity:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```

The fetch type is set to LAZY.

And let's suppose that your application is executing the following Java code:

```java
    List<Player> players = fromPlayer.getResultList();

    List<PlayerWithTeamName> playersWithTeamName = players
                                                  .stream()
                                                  .map(player -> new PlayerWithTeamName( player.getFirstName()
                                                                                       , player.getLastName()
                                                                                       , player.getTeam().getName()
                                                                                       )
                                                       )
                                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

# Easily detect N+1 selects with QuickPerf

You can detect N+1 select by adding ***[@ExpectSelect](./@ExpectSelect) annotation on a test method*** to check the number of executed SELECT statements.

The outcome of an N+1 select is to have the same SELECT statements with different values. You can systematically detect this by configuring ***@DisableSameSelectTypesWithDifferentParams annotation with a [global scope](https://github.com/quick-perf/doc/wiki/QuickPerf#annotation-scopes)***. In the previous examples, the outcome of the N+1 select was to have additional SELECT statements on Team table. These additional SELECT statements are the same apart from the id value of the Team table.

Hibernate code examples are available to play with these two ways of detecting N+1 selects: <br>
:point_right: &nbsp; [Hibernate JUnit 4 code example](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples/blob/master/hibernate-junit4/src/test/java/org/quickperf/sql/HibernateJUnit4Test.java) <br>

:point_right: &nbsp; [Hibernate TestNG code example](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples/blob/master/hibernate-testng/src/test/java/org/quickperf/sql/HibernateTestNGTest.java) <br>

The use of QuickPerf to detect N+1 selects in a Spring Boot, a Quarkus or a Micronaut application is demonstrated in [this repository](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples).

# Easily fix N+1 selects with QuickPerf

QuickPerf automatically detects that the tested code uses _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_. When a test is failing possibly due to an N+1 select, QuickPerf proposes ways to fix an N+1 select with _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_:

```
Perhaps you are facing a N+1 select issue
	* With Hibernate, you may fix it by using JOIN FETCH
	                                       or LEFT JOIN FETCH
	                                       or FetchType.LAZY
	                                       or ...
```
```
	* With Spring Data JPA, you may fix it by adding
		@EntityGraph(attributePaths = { "..." }) on repository method.
```
