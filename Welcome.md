# QuickPerf
QuickPerf is a Java open source project (Apache License, Version 2.0) that provides annotations to quickly evaluate some performance properties. <br>
Each annotation can be applied at class level, at method level or for each test.
An annotation configured at method level overrides the configuration of this annotation defined at class level. An annotation configured for each test is overridden by the same annotation defined at class level or method level. <br>

A JUnit 4 version is going to be released in January 2019.<br>
A Spring-JUnit 4 version will be available around February 2019.<br>
A JUnit 5 version will be available around March 2019.<br>
