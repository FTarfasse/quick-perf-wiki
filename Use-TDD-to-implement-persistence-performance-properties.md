_We could add many things to this document! It's a first version. However, we hope that it is interesting!_

At first, we are going to implement the functional behavior with the help of *Test-Driven Development* (TDD). In second step, we are going to use TDD to implement some persistence performance properties.

Let's imagine that you want to retrieve some data stored in a relational database.

Let's write a failing test!

```java
    @Test
    public void should_find_all_players() {

        PlayerRepository playerRepository = new PlayerRepository(entityManager);

        List<Player> players = playerRepository.findAll();

        assertThat(players).hasSize(2);

    }
```

```
java.lang.AssertionError: 
Expected size:<2> but was:<0>
```

The test fails because the implemenation returns an empty list:
```java
public class PlayerRepository {

    private final EntityManager entityManager;

    public PlayerRepository(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }

    public List<Player> findAll() {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }

}
```

Now let's write code to have a green test and to have a working functional behavior:

```java
public class PlayerRepository {

    private final EntityManager entityManager;

    public PlayerRepository(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }

    public List<Player> findAll() {
        return entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player").getResultList();
    }

}
```

Now we have a green test! :)

Let's clean up a little the code to have something a little more readable:

```java
public class PlayerRepository {

    private final EntityManager entityManager;

    public PlayerRepository(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }

    public List<Player> findAll() {
        Query loadPlayerQuery = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player");
        return loadPlayerQuery.getResultList();
    }

}
```

The test is still green!

Let's now evaluate a performance property!
We expect to retrieve the date with one select.

Let's check this with the help of an `ExpectSelect(1)` QuickPerf annotation:

```java
@QuickPerfTest
public class PlayerRepositoryTest {
    
    @ExpectSelect(1)
    @Test
    public void should_find_all_players() {

        PlayerRepository playerRepository = new PlayerRepository(entityManager);

        List<Player> players = playerRepository.findAll();

        assertThat(players).hasSize(2);

    }
```

Let's restart the test. Now the test is failing!
```
[PERF] You may think that <1> select statement was sent to the database
       But in fact <3>...

ðŸ’£  You may have even more select statements with production data.
Be careful with the cost of JDBC server roundtrips: https://blog.jooq.org/2017/12/18/the-cost-of-jdbc-server-roundtrips/
```

The code would be modified to have only one select sent to the database and to have a green test.

After that we could check other performance properties, as [the number of selected columns](https://github.com/quick-perf/doc/wiki/Why-limit-the-number-of-selected-columns): 

```java
@QuickPerfTest
public class PlayerRepositoryTest {

    @ExpectSelectedColumn(3)
    @ExpectSelect(1)
    @Test
    public void should_find_all_players() {

        PlayerRepository playerRepository = new PlayerRepository(entityManager);

        List<Player> players = playerRepository.findAll();

        assertThat(players).hasSize(2);

    }
```
